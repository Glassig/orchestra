# Orchestra
Orchestra is an application that was previously written using plain js & plain css, then redone better, then redone using gatsby+react+typescript and now I am attempting to make it React Native.

## Setup
I followed the [Getting started guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.60/getting-started), for React Native CLI.

The base template is the [Typescript one](https://reactnative.dev/docs/typescript).
